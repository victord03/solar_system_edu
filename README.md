# Solar System Edu

An educational visualization tool for illustrating the colossal distances, masses, and time scales of celestial bodies in our solar system. Helps users grasp astronomical concepts through relatable comparisons and interactive demonstrations.

## Concept

The vastness of space is difficult for the human mind to comprehend. This project aims to:
- Scale down astronomical distances to relatable units
- Compare planetary masses using everyday objects
- Visualize orbital periods and cosmic timeframes
- Provide interactive educational experiences

## Planned Features

- **Distance Scaling**: Show planetary distances using walking/driving time analogies
- **Mass Comparisons**: Relate planetary masses to familiar objects
- **Orbital Visualization**: Animated demonstration of planetary orbits to scale
- **Time Dilation**: Illustrate how time passes differently in space
- **Interactive Mode**: User-driven exploration of solar system facts

## Status

⚠️ **In Development** - Project structure established, implementation in progress. This is a passion project being developed incrementally.

## Inspiration

Inspired by educational content from:
- Carl Sagan's "Cosmos"
- Neil deGrasse Tyson's "Astrophysics for People in a Hurry"
- Interactive space visualizations
